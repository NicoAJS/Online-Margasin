            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor

            <p class="art-mp">The first decision you have to make when creating your first character is 
                the server or the realm. The server you pick is not very important. 
                You will be able to see the status of the server. Servers can be normal or 
                role playing (there is not a big of a difference.)</p>

        <img id="factions" src="billeder/factions.png" alt="world of warcraft factions, horde, alliance">
        <div>
            <h4 class="art-uh">Factions</h4>
            <p class="art-mp">The first big decision you have to make is choosing a faction. There are two 
                factions in World of Warcraft. Each faction has their own perspective of the 
                story line. For many people when they have picked a faction they tend to stick 
                to it on most of their characters. But I regiment you try both or have characters 
                on both sides.  The two factions are The Alliance and the Hored. Both factions 
                also have a given set of races you can choose from. This might also affect which 
                faction you choose.</p>
            
            <h5 class="art-mp">The Alliance</h5>
            <p class="art-mp">The Alliance is made up of several races who have banded together to 
                fight against their common enemies.</p>
            <p class="art-mp">he Alliance is often portrayed as the more noble and honorable of the 
                two factions, standing for justice, honor, and the protection of the innocent. Despite 
                this, the Alliance has also committed its share of atrocities in the name of victory, 
                and its leaders are not immune to the lure of power and ambition.
            </p>
            
            <h5 class="art-mp">The Horde</h5>
            <p class="art-mp">The Horde is made up of several races who have banded together to fight 
                for their survival and protect their way of life.
            </p>
            <p class="art-mp">The Horde is often portrayed as the underdog and evil faction. But they are simply 
                fighting against the odds to protect their way of life and ensure their survival.

            </p>
    
        </div>

        <img id="race" src="billeder/race.png" alt="world of warcraft races">
        <div>
            <h4 class="art-uh">Races</h4>
            <p class="art-mp">Choosing your race can be a big decision but I want you to remember that you can 
                always create another character. Blizzard the creators also allow for race changes for a small 
                fee. There are a total of 13 races you can choose from at the beginning. As you explore the games 
                you will be able to unlock an additional 11 races. Most races belong to a faction. This is due 
                to the history in the game.</p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="art-uh">The Alliance</h5>
            <p class="art-mp">Human, Dwarf, Night elf, Gnome, Draenei, Worgen and Pandaren.</p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="art-uh">The Hored</h5>
            <p class="art-mp">Orc, Undead, Tauren, Troll, Blood elf, Goblin and Pandaren</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img id="classes" src="billeder/classes.png" alt="world of warcraft classes">
            <h4 class="art-uh">Classes</h4>
            <p class="art-mp">After choosing a race you have to choose a class. The class you choose will define the way 
                you will play the game. Some classes have to come up an close to attack meanwell others can 
                stand at a distance. Some classes will have a mix of both or give you an option to choose. 
                Most classes will have 3 specializations but we will return to that further down. Not all 
                classes will be available to all races. This is the history of the game. There are a total 
                of 12 classes to choose from. You can also choose a class first and then your race.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="art-mp">Warrior, Hunter, Mage, Rogue, Priest, Warlock, Paladin, Druid, Shaman, Monk, Demon hunter and Death knight. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="art-mp">Close attackers or melee classes are warriors, hunter, rogue, paladin, druid, monk, demon hunter 
                and death night.</p>
            <p class="art-mp">Distance attackers or range classes are hunter, mage, priest, warlock, druid and shaman.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4 class="art-uh" id="custom">Customize</h4>
            <p class="art-mp">After choosing a faction, race and class you will be able to customize your character. 
                Here you make your character's appearance and give them their name. You might have to 
                try a couple of names. There can only be one of each name in each realm. Regarding your 
                appearance it can be changed later on in the game at a barber shop and it only costs 
                gold which you will earn as you play. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img id="specimg" src="billeder/spec.png" alt="world of warcraft spec">
            <h4 class="art-uh">Specialization </h4>
            <p class="art-mp">Once you reach level 10 you will have to choose a specialization also called a spec. 
                There are 3 specs: damage, healer and tank. Once you have chosen you can alway change it. </p>
            
            <h5 class="art-uh">Tank</h5>
            <p class="art-mp">A tank is a character that can take a lot of damage and can stay alive longer. They do not 
                do as much damage and only have a few healing spells. </p>
            
            <h5 class="art-uh">Healer</h5>
            <p class="art-mp">Healers are characters that specialize in healing spells. You do not do as much damage as 
                a damage or a tank. Nor can you take as many hits as a tank. However you can keep yourself 
                and others alive. When you fight one on one it will draw out but you are able to win in the 
                long run. </p>

            <h5 class="art-uh">Damage</h5>
            <p class="art-mp">Damage is the most played spec. All classes have a damage spec and it is also the spec 
                where you can do the most damage to your target. However you have every few healing 
                spells and you yourself can not tag as many hits. You therefore has to kill your target fast. </p>

                <h2>How to level up</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="artintro-p">
                <p>Leveling up in the game is not as complicated as I might look at first glance. 
                    Once you have made your character you will be brought to the starting area for 
                    your race or class. There you will be able to learn your character before you 
                    are let loose into the world.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4 class="art-uh">Follow the intro quest</h4>
                <p class="art-mp">The easiest way is to follow the starting quest line. This will guide you 
                    to understanding your character. You will easily be able to see an available quest. The 
                    NPC (Non player character) will have a big yellow exclamation mark over them. Go talk 
                    to them and they will give you an easy starting assignment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="art-mp">
                Once you have completed the quest an NPC (most likely the same as the one you got the quest 
                from) will have a big yellow question mark over them. Talk to them and complete your quest.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4 class="art-uh">Qusting</h4>
                <p class="art-mp">Questing is a major aspect of World of Warcraft gameplay and an easy way 
                    to level up and get the story. Quest will reward you with new and higher level gear but 
                    also experience or XP. Once you reach level 10 which you will reach pretty fast. You 
                    have to choose an expansion which simply means you have to choose the past story you 
                    would like to follow.
                </p>

            <img id="expan" src="billeder/expan.png" alt="World of warcarfts expansions/timelines">
            <div>
                <h4 class="art-uh">Expansions </h4>
                <p class="art-mp">There are 7 different expansions or time lines you can choose from. 
                    The Cataclysm, Portal to Outland, Fall of the Lich King, Wilds of Panaria, The Iron 
                    Horde, The Legion Invasion and The Realms of Death. Before choosing you are able to 
                    read a little about the storyline. You are able to change your chosen timeline at any time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="art-mp">You will follow your chosen timeline until level 60. When you reach 
                    level 60 you will get a quest that will bring you to the current expansion. Where 
                    you will follow the newest timeline. </p>
            </div>

            <img id="dun" src="billeder/dungen.png" alt="World of warcarft dungeons">
            <div>
                <h4 class="art-uh">Dungeons</h4>
                <p class="art-mp">Dungeons are another way of leveling up. Do not recommend going into 
                    dungeons before you are comfortable playing your character. But once you are comfortable 
                    you should try them.
                </p>
                <p class="art-mp">Dungeons is a group mission to complete a mission. This usually consists of 
                    killing bosses and mobs (small groups of enemies). But it is a faster way to level up and 
                    you get better gear at the same time. </p>
